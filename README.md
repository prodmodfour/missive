# missive

`missive` is an early-stage Rust command-line tool and local control plane for A2A-native agent communication. The long-term goal is to make agent messaging feel like `curl`, agent communication state feel like `kubectl`, and multi-agent coordination feel like MPI-style collective operations.

## Current status

This repository is at early workspace stage. It contains:

* a Cargo workspace with the target crate layout under `crates/`
* a `missive-cli` package that exposes the binary named `missive`
* repository hygiene files and guardrails
* the autonomous ticket queue used to build the project one commit at a time
* starter documentation directories, including `docs/adr/`

Current crates:

```text
crates/missive-cli        command parsing, output rendering, exit codes
crates/missive-core       domain types, errors, config, IDs, envelopes
crates/missive-a2a        A2A protocol/client integration and compatibility fixtures
crates/missive-store      SQLite migrations and repository APIs
crates/missive-router     agent selection, policies, groups, collectives
crates/missive-gateway    daemon, subscriptions, webhooks, jobs, sessions
crates/missive-adapters   stdin/stdout, file, HTTP, future chat adapters
crates/missive-observe    tracing, logs, diagnostics, event export helpers
```

The current binary is still only a placeholder:

```bash
cargo run -p missive-cli --bin missive
```

Future tickets add real CLI commands, A2A integration, persistence, gateway, adapters, collectives, tests, and packaging.

## Build and validation

Prerequisites:

* Rust stable toolchain with `cargo`, `rustfmt`, and `clippy`
* Bash for repository scripts

Check or install local build tooling with:

```bash
scripts/bootstrap-tools.sh --check
scripts/bootstrap-tools.sh
```

The bootstrap script is idempotent and best-effort. Optional tools are skipped by
the quality gate when absent and used automatically when present. See
[`docs/tooling.md`](docs/tooling.md) for the full tool inventory, `sudo`/package
manager policy, and aggressive validation options.

Validate the checkout with:

```bash
scripts/quality-gate.sh
```

Useful direct Rust commands during this bootstrap phase:

```bash
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace --all-features
cargo build --workspace --all-features
```

Runtime state, credentials, logs, database files, generated artifacts, and other machine-local files must stay out of the repository.

## Autonomous build system

The repository is driven by ordered tickets in `BUILD_TICKETS.md`. Each autonomous run must complete only the lowest-numbered `TODO` or `IN_PROGRESS` ticket, run the quality gate, update `BUILD_NOTES.md`, and commit the result.

Key files:

* `AGENTS.md` — autonomous agent rules
* `PROJECT_BRIEF.md` — project goals, constraints, and architecture expectations
* `BUILD_TICKETS.md` — ordered implementation queue
* `BUILD_NOTES.md` — latest validation notes and next ticket
* `docs/AUTONOMOUS_BUILD.md` — build-loop model
* `docs/USAGE.md` — autonomous build usage
